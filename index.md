## The story so far...

Welcome, adventurer, to my realm of cybersecurity!
My name is Defendgu, and I am a seeker of knowledge and power in the mystical realm of reverse engineering malware.

As I travel through the treacherous landscapes of assembly code and navigate the intricate webs of networking technologies, I am constantly challenged by the dark forces of cyber threats that seek to corrupt and destroy. But armed with the knowledge of CompTIA's Network+ scroll, I am determined to protect the innocent and defeat the forces of evil.

But my journey does not end there. I am currently on a quest to obtain the knowledge that is hidden within the CySA+ and Linux+ scrolls, which will unlock even greater levels of mastery in this mystical art. Through my website, I will share the secrets and wisdom that I have gained on this perilous journey, providing valuable insights and guidance to fellow adventurers in the realm of cybersecurity.
