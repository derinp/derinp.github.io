# Title: "This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends" by Nicole Perlroth

I read this book about a year ago and I have been meaning to share my thoughts on it. I've really been procrastinating on writing all these book reviews. I didnt keep up the theme of this being a "fantasy world" with my last book review because I didnt want that to be too distracting on the actual content of the book. With that said, expect my book reviews to just be in normal english.

In "This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends," cybersecurity journalist Nicole Perlroth provides a comprehensive and unsettling look at the world of cyber warfare and the growing threat of cyber attacks on critical infrastructure.

The book is a must-read for anyone interested in cybersecurity, as it provides a detailed examination of the complex web of actors involved in cyber attacks, including nation-states, hackers, and cybersecurity firms. Perlroth's reporting is thorough and insightful, drawing on her extensive experience covering cybersecurity for The New York Times.

One of the key themes of the book is the extent to which governments have created a market for zero-day exploits and other hacking tools, often paying exorbitant sums of money for these tools while neglecting to invest in their own cybersecurity personnel. Perlroth explores the dangers of this approach, highlighting the potential for these tools to fall into the wrong hands and be used to cause significant harm.

The book also delves into the mysterious group known as the Shadow Brokers, who gained notoriety in 2016 when they released a trove of highly classified hacking tools allegedly stolen from the National Security Agency (NSA). Perlroth examines the group's alleged ties to Russia and the difficulty of attributing cyber attacks to specific actors or countries.

Throughout the book, Perlroth underscores the urgent need for stronger cybersecurity measures to protect against cyber attacks on critical infrastructure, such as power grids and transportation systems. She also emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and transparency in the global cybersecurity community.

Overall, "This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends" is a well-researched and engaging book that sheds light on the dark world of cyber warfare and the growing threat of cyber attacks on our interconnected world.
