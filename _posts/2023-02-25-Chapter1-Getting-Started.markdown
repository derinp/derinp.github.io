# Getting Started

Welcome to my digital abode, where I chronicle my journey through the wondrous world of cybersecurity.

As I navigate through the perilous and ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, I have come to realize the importance of sharing my knowledge and experiences with fellow adventurers. This website is my way of documenting my journey, sharing my learnings, and building a community of like-minded individuals who share the same passion for cybersecurity.

On this journey, I plan to provide walkthroughs for challenges on Hackthebox and Tryhackme, which are like magical portals to hone your skills and explore real-world scenarios. I will also share my experiences with my home labs, where I conduct experiments with various tools and technologies, furthering my knowledge and skills in this mystical art.

Most importantly, I wish to connect with other cybersecurity enthusiasts, to learn from their experiences, and to work together towards safeguarding the digital realm from the forces of darkness. So join me, fellow adventurers, and let us journey together through the mystical world of cybersecurity!

This was nothing more than an update on what to expect. First up, I will document the creation of my own homelab, a safe space to practice all my spells!
